## Introduction

Nuclei RNA-seq generates sequencing reads that map across a whole gene (intron and exon) and therefore a nuclei-specific reference genome is generated for sequencing read counting.


```{bash}
#!/bin/bash

grep -w gene Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.gtf | cut -f1,4,5,7,9| cut -d '"' -f-2,6 \
        | sed 's/gene_id "//' | tr '"' '_'\
        | awk '{OFS="\t"}  {print $5,$1,$2,$3,$4}' > Mus_musculus.GRCm38.96.fulllength.saf

```
